<h1>Sniv Gantt Chart</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Goal: display all the snivs of a set of resources over time. Resources are TADs, CFIs, students, and planes.
	</li>
	<li>This should have the resources listed as rows and time period horizontally. At its most basic, it could be day/date across the top with unavailable waves as the cell entries. This is what we used last year. On hover, the times and reason should be displayed.
	</li>
	<li>A more sophisticated version could have a visual depiction of available each day directly tied to the times of the sniv. The default availability (from an hour before sunrise to an hour after sunset) would be a green bar and and unavailability would be displayed as a red bar over the green. Again, on hover the times and reason should be displayed.
	</li>
	<li>This could involved showing a large number of days. As someone scrolls, the resource names should stay visible on the left.
	</li>
	<li>For planes, this should display the plane's hours as well.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Demo: The waves numbers give unavailability</h2>
